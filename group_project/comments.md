# Critique of MIDUS study reproducibility

1. Is the data publicly available?
   Yes
 
2. Is the data easy/intuitive to access?
  Yes

3. Is there a codebook and/or instructions about how the data and documentation is organized?
    Yes, but it was not always clear

4. Are the file names intuitive?
    NO
    
5. Are the variable names intuitive?
   NO
6. Is the software used for analysis publicly available?
   No, they use SAS v9.2 that is not available, and they do not give details of what they did on SAS
7. If the software is available, is it well commented?
   no
8. Is there a toy example provided?
    No
9.  Are you able to reproduce the figures, tables and results presented in the paper?
    The variables seem to be all there, but we had a hard time matching them 1-1 with what was done in the paper.
    We got to 994 samples, instead of 990 and for some of the variables it looks like we have different distributions of
    the values.

10. Was there anything you think should have been made clearer, or explained in a different way?
    
11. Did you find any faults in the methods used in this paper? Would you have used more or different methods?
    The alcohol consumption, reported as drinks/week, but based on the reproduction steps it looks like they use
    drinks/day of drinking.
    The blood pressure medication variables were not clear
    We did not understand if the lipid levels had to be corrected, or were already corrected in the dataset
